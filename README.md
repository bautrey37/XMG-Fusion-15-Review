# XMG Fusion 15 Review
Review of my XMG Fusion 15 with Pop OS

This review comes from the perspective of someone who has not used Linux on their personal computer full time and coming from Windows and Mac backgrounds. I am a developer who also likes to game casually

## Setup

### Installing Pop!_OS

### Installing drivers



## First Impressions

Very nice computer. The keyboard definately takes some getting used too. Sometimes the keys do not type when I press them so its like I need to use more force. The keys feel like they are bigger and more spaced out than the macbook I was uses before.

## Issues

### Linux OS

1. Dropbox Pro features are not fully supported such as Smart Sync. Making the service not very useful and will take up too much space.


### Hardware

1. Touchpad light for on/off does not light up
2. Keyboard per key RGB and lightbar is not configurable
    a. Maybe using this software will help: https://www.reddit.com/r/XMG_gg/comments/hrv2qb/xmg_fusion_15_per_key_rgb_backlight_lightbar/


## Gaming

Interested in playing:
- Witcher 3
- Civilization 6
